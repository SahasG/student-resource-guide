Title: Student Resource Guide

Team Members: Ben Tarmann, Charlie Jamieson, Sahas Gelli, Jiun-Ting Chen

Description: This project is a program that helps students learn more about services available to them on campus. This would be a searchable collection of all resources
available. Each resource is divided in a category, to make resources easily identifiable for people looking for something specific. There would also be a list of the most
commonly used resources so that people could see which resources are most popular.
